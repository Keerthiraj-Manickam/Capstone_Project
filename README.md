# CAPSTONE PROJECT

## 📌 Project Overview
This capstone project involves web scraping, data storage, and machine learning to analyze various product categories. The extracted data is processed and stored in a MySQL database, followed by clustering and predictive modeling.

## 🚀 Features
### ✅ Web Scraping
- **Men's Clothing**
- **Women's Clothing**
- **Footwear & Accessories**
- **Home Essentials**
- **Beauty & Personal Care**
- **Stationery & Home Decor**
- **Feature Brands**

### ✅ Data Processing
- Merging multiple CSV files into one dataset
- Storing data in MySQL

### ✅ Machine Learning
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering with **DBSCAN** and **KMeans**
- **Supervised Learning:** Model selection for predictions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing & machine learning)
- **Selenium** (for web scraping)
- **MySQL** (for data storage)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
